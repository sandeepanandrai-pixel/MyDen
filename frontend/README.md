# My Fullstack App

This is a fullstack application built with React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React. It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains all the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: Main component that sets up routing.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable components.
  - `pages/`: Contains page components like Home.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - A NoSQL database for storing application data.

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express. It handles API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database.

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/items`: Retrieve all items.
- `POST /api/items`: Create a new item.
